# Bitwise Operators in C

## AND (&)

## OR (|)

## NOT (~)

## XOR (^)

## SHIFT LEFT (<<)

## SHIFT RIGHT (>>)

### Bit Order / Bit significance
#### Most Significant Bit (MSB)
- The highest-order bit in a binary number, or the bit with the highest value position.
- It represents the largest possible value in the binary number.
- In an 8-bit number like 10011001, the leftmost bit (1) is the MSB.
- The MSB is sometimes referred to as the "sign bit" in signed binary representations, as it determines the sign (positive or negative) of the number in two's complement representation.

#### Least Significant Bit (LSB)
- The lowest-order bit in a binary number, or the bit with the smallest value position.
- It represents the smallest possible value in the binary number (either 0 or 1).
- In the number 10011001, the rightmost bit (1) is the LSB.
- The LSB is also sometimes called the "rightmost bit" or simply the "low bit."

### Byte Order / Endianness
#### Big Endian
#### Small Endian
